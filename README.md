# IBM-Quantum-ML-QGSS2021

The Qiskit Summer School is an IBM-sponsored event to promote quantum computing. Qiskit is the name of the language developed by IBM. This year, it was the second edition of the event, and the theme was Quantum Machine Learning.

There were two weeks of classes, and 5 rounds of labs â€” each with a variable number of graded exercises.
